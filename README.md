# HTML_template_shopify

## Navigating to the collection template on shopify
> <p>When a user is inside of the designated shopify store, they will click to 'Products' on the left hand side, and under products, click to 'Collections'.</p>
> <p>Once they have clicked on 'Collections', they will scroll or search to find the collection page they would like to edit.</p>

## Adding the Template to the Collection Page
> <p>When a user is on the collection page they would like to edit, they will need to head to the 'description' box inside of the collection page, and in the right hand corner of the rich text editor, they will see the 'Show HTML' button which will appear as '</>'. Once the 'Show HTML' button is clicked, the html of the description box will display, this is where they will add in the html template. </p>
> <p>Once the user has navigated to the html of the collection description, they will scroll to the bottom of the description html, it is important that the html template is inserted at the very bottom of the html to ensure the correct heirarchy of the collection page.</p>
> <p>The next step is to copy the 'template.html' file from inside of this repository. Once copied, it can be pasted at the very bottom of the description html inside of the Shopify Collection page. Afterwards, navigate to the correct collection page on the site and the template should display!</p>

## Editing the HTML Template
> <p>When editing the html template, it is important that the class names, tag names, and the 'split' tag remains the same to ensure that all styling reaches its necessary blocks. All content and images can be edited otherwise.</p>
> <p>All styling is located inside of the 'styles.scss.liquid' file nested inside of the Shopify store.</p>
> <p>Each section inside of the 'template.html' code is notated to find the correct section the user is looking for.</p>
> ## Remaining A.D.A. Compliant
> <p>To ensure that the template remains ADA compliant, all images added to a live store must obtain "alt text".</p>
