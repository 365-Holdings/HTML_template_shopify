            <h3>Why an Emergency Food Supply and Why Now?</h3>
            <p>
                The world has never been so unpredictable. The rise of natural disasters, war, and economic instability
                have led to a need for emergency food kits. Emergency food kits are becoming more popular as the world
                becomes more unstable. One thing we all learned from the latest pandemic is that no one is immune to
                empty store shelves. Having a supply of survival food on hand is an insurance plan against your family
                going hungry.

            <h3>Be Ready for an Uncertain Future with Long Term Food Storage</h3>
            <p>
                It is important to be prepared for the future. You never know what might happen and it is always better
                to have the emergency food supplies ready before you need them. Once disaster happens, it’s too late to
                put together enough long term food storage to keep your family fed. The CDC recommends having at least 3
                days of food storage, but we all know that in the event of a real disaster, food supplies could be
                disrupted for weeks or months or even longer. Having survival food on hand ensures that you’re not at
                the mercy of a fickle government agency or handouts from your neighbors.

    <h2>What's the Best Emergency Food Supply for You and Your Family?</h2>

    <h3>What You Should Know about Buying Emergency Meal Kits?</h3>
    <p>
        The key to long-term food storage is not just about storing up a lot of food. It’s about storing the right food
        in the right way. Ask yourself this: when you go to the grocery store, does it bother you to buy food that is
        packed with artificial ingredients, chemicals, and just plain junk? If so, pay close attention to the nutrition
        labels on the survival food you buy. The long term food storage industry is full of producers who pack their
        foods with cheap junk and empty calories to decrease their costs. You will never find that at Valley Food
        Storage. We produce a clean, simple emergency food supply that has the same ingredients you’d use in your own
        cooking.

    <h3>How to Store &amp; Organize Emergency Food Supplies</h3>
    <p>
        Emergency food supplies are only as useful as they are safe and accessible. Having a stack of survival food kits
        that have spoiled from poor storage or contain foods your family won’t eat isn’t much of a help. You’ll want to
        occasionally cook foods from your long term food storage to make sure it’s enjoyable and you don’t struggle to
        prepare it for the first time when you’re under a stressful emergency. One of the reasons we offer a <a
            href="https://valleyfoodstorage.com/products/72-hour-emergency-food-kit">72 hour emergency food kit</a> is
        to give you a selection of foods for a low price that you can try out before you have to rely on them. Then make
        sure to keep your survival food in a dry cool place. Often a shelf in the basement or a closet in the interior
        of your home make good, temperature stable survival food storage locations.

            The best survival foods provide clean, sustainable nutrition that will keep you performing well in an
            emergency situation. They also need to be shelf stable and easy to prepare. That’s why we make all our
            survival food kits with simple ingredients that you’re likely already using in your home cooking, we just
            dehydrate them and make them shelf stable. That way you have long term food storage that won’t mess with
            your digestive system, but is always ready for any emergency.

        </h3>
        <div id="accordioncontent_2" class="accordion-content">
            The cheapest survival food is probably bags of rice and beans. They’re already pretty storage stable, and if
            you package them in nitrogen gas inside of mylar bags packed in buckets, they’ll last even longer. But how
            happy will your family be living on meals of plain rice with plain beans for months? Both rice and beans
            also require hours of boiling, which may not be possible in an emergency situation. For that reason, they
            shouldn’t make up the entirety of your emergency food supply.
            <br><br>
            There are also other companies that make cheaper survival food than Valley Food Storage. Our goal wasn’t a
            race to the bottom to produce the cheapest calories we could pass off as emergency food. Before you buy from
            any other company, compare their nutrition labels to Valley Food Storage nutrition labels. You’ll recognize
            all the ingredients in our food. But that’s not the case for most other emergency food kit providers. In an
            emergency don’t count on chemicals and fillers for your family’s survival.

            Obviously, we’re biased. Each menu item at Valley Food Storage has been carefully selected and configured to

            keeping your family out of them. They’re delicious just as is. And we make a mango habanero chili that you’d
            be happy to serve to guests even before anything hits any fans. Don’t add terrible food to the list of
            hardships you’ll be surviving in an emergency situation. Make sure your survival food is a source of
            comfort.

        </h3>
        <div id="accordioncontent_4" class="accordion-content">
            We always recommend keeping shelf stable staples on hand. Make sure you have some extra rice and canned
            tuna. The protein bars you can buy at the grocery store are also great. Just make sure to buy things that
            you already eat so that you can keep cycling through them and they don’t go bad. Then if the power goes out
            for a day or there’s a snowstorm, you have easy access to food supplies.
            <br><br>
            However, when we talk about an emergency food kit we’re not talking about food for a day. We’re talking
            about food for 2 months when things have really gotten rough. In that case, you’re going to want a supply of
            <a href="https://valleyfoodstorage.com/collections/fruits-vegetables">freeze dried fruits and vegetables</a>
            for their nutrients, <a href="https://valleyfoodstorage.com/collections/freeze-dried-meat">freeze dried
                meat</a> for protein, and packaged survival food that you know will still be safe to eat even though you

                While it may feel comforting to see products steadily finding their way back onto the store shelves that
